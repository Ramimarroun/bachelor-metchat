MongoDB:
Create remote database hosted on mongo DB on a service called, Atlas. Which is owned by same company that involves MongoDB.  
For developing our project, we will not using a local database on our computer

Why using hosted database using Atlas:

- Having our data on cloud
- We can develop our application from everywhere and, even we donâ€™t have to export data from the local database and then upload it to a hosted database
  once we are ready to deploy our application. Instead, we simply use this hosted database right from beginning, instead of even messing with local databases
  in the first place.

## Want to use your own database?

In the server directrory there's a file called db.js. Change the value of mongoURL in the file to cange to your own cloud database, with your own mongodb connection url.
