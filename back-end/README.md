MongoDB:
Create remote database hosted on mongo DB on a service called, Atlas. Which is owned by same company that involves MongoDB.  
For developing our project, we will not using a local database on our computer 

Why using hosted database using Atlas:
-	Having our data on cloud 
-	We can develop our application from everywhere and, even we donâ€™t have to export data from the local database and then upload it to a hosted database
once we are ready to deploy our application. Instead, we simply use this hosted database right from beginning, instead of even messing with local databases
in the first place.
